An interactive version of Emma Lazarus's "The New Colossus", which appears on
the base of the Statue of Liberty.

The annotations are written by Esther Schor, author of the biography, *Emma
Lazarus*. Designed by the wonderful [Joshua Hester](http://joshuahester.com/)
with art direction from [Len Small](http://www.lensmalldesign.com/) of Nextbook
Press.

All JavaScript and jQuery is of my own creation unless otherwise noted with
alterations to the HTML and CSS.
